						Billy King was born on July 18, 1974 at UT Hospital. He has lived in Knoxville, Tennessee for most of his life, aside from short periods spent in Union County, Kingsport, and Edmond, Oklahoma. He is the father of three children: Blake, Kelsey, and Jobe. <br /><br />
						
						When he isn't working or dealing with the latest dilemma his children have managed to create, he spends his free time enjoying life with his new bride, Angie, or thinking of new ways to upgrade his motorcycle. He is a football fanatic (Go Vols), and spends as much time as he can giving back to his alma mater, Central High School.

					<p class="school_football_text"> Billy started school at Central High in 1989 and graduated in 1993. His football career began freshman year. Like many, he was not able to play much in his first year. Starting sophomore year, he began playing with All Kil, and continued to do so throughout his senior year. He played strong safety and linebacker junior year and was best in position, as well as joining the All State team. He became quarterback senior year, allowing him to gain the publicity he needed to be awarded a full ride scholarship to Carson-Newman University. Billy is remembered as one of the greats, and is permenantly on display on Central's Wall of Fame. <p>
